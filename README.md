***E-commerce is clearly beginning to have a major impact in the agricultural sector. The way people go about purchasing agricultural products is of great concern. Most of the time customers have to travel far distances to get agricultural products and getting the right quality is not ensured. Besides, farming is the prime occupation in India. Indian people involved in farming are mostly cheated by the agents in today’s market which leads to poverty. Our project aims to help farmers as well as customers for buying and selling agricultural products across the country using a computerized approach. The website will guide the farmers to access new farming techniques, compare current market rate of different products, the total sale and the earned profit for the sold products. The website builds a platform for farmers and agents to ensure greater profitability through direct farmer to farmer, farmer to agent and farmer to customer communication. The website will act as a unique and secure way to perform agro-marketing. E-farming will serve as a way for the farmers to sell their products across the country just with some basic knowledge about how to use the website. This project allows viewing various products available enables users to purchase desire products instantly by online payment. This website would be developed using web service as the communication infrastructure between the buyer and farmers and also products selling.***
